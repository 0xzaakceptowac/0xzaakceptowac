# Hello!

My name is Tyronne Joshua Betita, 

I am an aspiring cybersecurity engineer and a CTF player. I created this GitHub profile to showcase my projects and more importantly having fun while learning new stuff. I may have started late on this kind of stuff but it is better late than never they say.

I also store random shit here so that in the future I can look back and reflect on how much I have grown as a tech degenerate.
